This post is about our new line of project(s) that aims to automate data preparation (prep) for ML. I'm presenting a workshop [paper](https://adalabucsd.github.io/papers/2019_DataPrepZoo_DEEM.pdf) at DEEM, SIGMOD 2019 titled *The ML Data Prep Zoo: Towards Semi-Automatic Data Preparation for ML*. It is co-authored with my advisor, Arun Kumar.


Introduction
============================

Data preparation (prep) still remains a major bottleneck for building any real-world ML application. Several surveys of data science practiontioners have shown that the time spent in data prep can go as high as 80% of their time.
