*  I am a Staff Research Scientist at the [IBM Almaden Research Center](https://research.ibm.com/labs/almaden/).
*  I completed my PhD at the University of California San Diego, advised by [Dr. Arun Kumar](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~arunkk/) in the [Computer Science Department](http://cse.ucsd.edu/). While at UCSD, I was a member of [ADA Lab](https://adalabucsd.github.io/) headed by [Dr. Arun Kumar](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~arunkk/). My research focused on the synthesis of DB schema management & ML techniques to help simplify and automate critical ML data prep steps on tabular data. 
* Before starting my Ph.D, I obtained my B.Tech degree from [Indian Institute of Technology, Indore](http://www.iiti.ac.in/).
